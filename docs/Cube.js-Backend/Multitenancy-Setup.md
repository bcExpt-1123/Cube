Cube.js supports multitenancy out of the box, both on database and data schema levels. Multiple drivers are also supported, meaning that you can have one customerâ€™s data in MongoDB and others in Postgres with one Cube.js instance.

There are 4 configuration options you can leverage to make your multitenancy setup. You
can use all of them or just a couple, depending on your specific case. The
options are:

- `contextToAppId`
- `dbType`
- `driverFactory`
- `repositoryFactory`

All of the above options are functions, which you provide on Cube.js server instance creation. The
functions accept one argument - context object, which has a nested object -
`authInfo`, which acts as a container, where you can provide all the necessary data to identify user, organization, app, etc. You put data into `authInfo` when creating a Cube.js API Token.

## Example

Let's consider the following example:

We store data for different users in different databases, but on the same Postgres host. The database name is `my_app_1_2`, where `1`
is **Application ID** and `2` is **User ID**.

To make it work with Cube.js,
first we need to pass the `appId` and `userId` as context to every query. We
should include that into our token generation code.

```javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const CUBE_API_SECRET='secret';

const cubejsToken = jwt.sign(
  { appId: appId, userId: userId },
  CUBE_API_SECRET,
  { expiresIn: '30d' }
);
```

Now, we can access them inside the `driverFactory` option.

```javascript
const PostgresDriver = require("@cubejs-backend/postgres-driver");

new CubejsServer({
  driverFactory: ({ authInfo }) =>
    new PostgresDriver({
      database: `my_app_${authInfo.appId}_${authInfo.userId}`
    })
});
```
