title: "Building a Dashboard"
---

In the previous part we've built our basic data schema and first few charts. In
this part we'll build a dashboard with the users chart and several new metrics.

First, we need to slightly update the `DashboardPage` component to extract
setting `timeDimensions` property into a separate function. It's going to be a common property for all our queries. We also are going to make it dynamic based on the user's input in the next part of this tutorial.

Replace the content of the `dashboard-app/src/pages/DashboardPage.js` with the
following.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import Grid from "@material-ui/core/Grid";
import ChartRenderer from "../components/ChartRenderer";
import Dashboard from "../components/Dashboard";
import DashboardItem from "../components/DashboardItem";
const DashboardItems = [
  {
    id: 0,
    name: "Users",
    vizState: {
      query: {
        measures: ["Sessions.usersCount"]
      },
      chartType: "line"
    }
  },
];

const withTimeDimension = ({ query, ...options }) => ({
  ...options,
  query: {
    timeDimensions: [
      {
        dimension: "Sessions.timestamp",
        granularity: "day",
        dateRange: "Last 30 days"
      }
    ],
    ...query
  }
});

const DashboardPage = () => {
  const dashboardItem = item => (
    <Grid item xs={12} lg={6} key={item.id}>
      <DashboardItem title={item.name}>
        <ChartRenderer vizState={withTimeDimension(item.vizState)} />
      </DashboardItem>
    </Grid>
  );

  return <Dashboard>{DashboardItems.map(dashboardItem)}</Dashboard>
};

export default DashboardPage;
```

## New Users

As you can see we already have the Users chart in place. Let's add few more. First, let's add the KPI chart to display the number of new users. To do that, we need to
a create a new measure in our data schema to count only new users. To
distinguish **New** users from **Returning** we're going to use session's index
set by Snowplow tracker - `domain_sessionidx`.

Let's first create a new `type` dimension in the `Sessions` cube. We're using
[case property](https://cube.dev/docs/dimensions#parameters-case) to make this dimension return either `New` or `Returning` based on the
value of `domain_sessionidx`.

```js
type: {
  type: `string`,
  case: {
    when: [{ sql: `${CUBE}.domain_sessionidx = 1`, label: `New`}],
    else: { label: `Returning` }
  },
  title: `User Type`
}
```

Next, let's define `newUsersCount` measure by using [filters
property](https://cube.dev/docs/measures#parameters-filters) to select
only **new** sessions.

Add the following measure to the `Sessions` cube.


```js
newUsersCount: {
  type: `countDistinct`,
  sql: `domain_userid`,
  filters: [
    { sql: `${type} = 'New'` }
  ],
  title: "New Users"
}
```

Finally, on the frontend in the `dashboard-app/src/pages/DashboardPage.js` file add the following query to the `DashboardItems` array.

```js
{
  id: 1,
  size: 3,
  name: "New Users",
  vizState: {
    query: {
      measures: ["Sessions.newUsersCount"],
      timeDimensions: [
        {
          dimension: "Sessions.timestamp",
          granularity: null,
          dateRange: "Last 30 days"
        }
      ]
    },
    chartType: "number"
  }
}
```

## Average Number of Events per Session

To calculate the average we need to have the number of events per session first. We can achieve that by creating a [subQuery dimension](https://cube.dev/docs/subquery#top). Subquery dimensions are used to reference measures from other cubes inside a dimension.

To make subQuery work we need to define a relationship between `Events` and `Sessions` cubes. Since, every event belongs to some session, we're going to define `belongsTo` join. You can [learn more about joins in Cube.js here](https://cube.dev/docs/joins#top).

Add the following block to the `Events` cube.

```js
joins: {
  Sessions: {
    relationship: `belongsTo`,
    sql: `${CUBE}.domain_sessionid = ${Sessions.id}`
  }
}
```

We'll calculate count of events, which we already have as a measure in the `Events` cube, as a dimension in the Sessions cube.

Once, we have this dimension we can easily calculate its average as a measure.

```js
// Add the following dimension to the Sessions cube
eventsCount: {
  type: `number`,
  sql: `${Events.count}`,
  subQuery: true
}

// Add the following measure to the Sessions cube
avgEvents: {
  type: `number`,
  sql: `round(avg(${eventsCount}))`
}
```

Same as the previous one we'll add average number of events per sessions as a
KPI chart. Add the following query to the `DashboardItems` array.

```js
{
  id: 2,
  size: 3,
  name: "Avg. Events per Session",
  vizState: {
    query: {
      measures: ["Sessions.avgEvents"],
      timeDimensions: [
        {
          dimension: "Sessions.timestamp",
          granularity: null,
          dateRange: "Last 30 days"
        }
      ]
    },
    chartType: "number"
  }
}
```

## Users by Type

Now, let's add the pie chart! We can use it to show the ratio of
New vs Returning users to our website. We already have the `type` dimension
which shows exactly this, so all we need here is to add the following query to
our `DashboardItems` array in the frontend app.

```js
{
  id: 3,
  size: 6,
  name: "Users by Type",
  vizState: {
    query: {
      measures: ["Sessions.usersCount"],
      dimensions: ["Sessions.type"],
      timeDimensions: [
        {
          dimension: "Sessions.timestamp",
          granularity: null,
          dateRange: "Last 30 days"
        }
      ]
    },
    chartType: "pie"
  }
}
```

## Sessions by Referrer Medium

That's a quite metric if we want to figure which channel or medium bring the
most traffic to our website. Snowplow sets the `refr_medium`, so we just
need to clean up the values a little bit in the data schema.

```js
referrerMedium: {
  type: `string`,
  case: {
    when: [
      { sql: `${CUBE}.refr_medium IS NULL`, label: 'direct' },
      { sql: `${CUBE}.refr_medium = 'unknown'`, label: 'other' },
      { sql: `${CUBE}.refr_medium != ''`, label: { sql: `${CUBE}.refr_medium` } }
    ],
    else: { label: '(none)' }
  }
}
```

## Bounce Rate
The next metric we're going to create is the **Bounce Rate**.

A bounced session is usually defined as a session with only one event. Since weâ€™ve already defined the number of events per session, we can easily add a dimension `isBounced` to identify bounced sessions to the `Sessions` cube. Using this dimension, we can add two measures to the `Sessions` cube as well - a count of bounced sessions and a bounce rate.

```js
// Add the following dimension to the Sessions cube
isBounced: {
 type: `string`,
  case: {
    when: [ { sql: `${eventsCount} = 1`, label: `True` }],
    else: { label: `False` }
  }
}

// Add the following measures to the Sessuins cube
bouncedCount: {
  type: `count`,
  filters:[{
    sql: `${isBounced} = 'True'`
  }]
},

bounceRate: {
  sql: `100.00 * ${bouncedCount} / NULLIF(${count}, 0)`,
  type: `number`,
  format: `percent`
}
```
